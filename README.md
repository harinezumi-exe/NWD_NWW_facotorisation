# NWD_NWW_facotorisation
 A C++ program that factors given number and uses those factors to calculate greatest common divisor and least common multiple.
 
 Although the Euclidean algorithm is definetely a cleaner and faster solution, I wanted to give myself a challenge and try to emulate the way I was taght to do it in school.
 
 This program was made as a C++ training. If I were to recommand a way to approach calculating GCD & LCM, I'd advise using the Euclidean algorithm.
